# RomSetManager
Manage all your retro-roms.

Readme under development...will get finished soon.

## What is it about:
If you have tons of roms lying around on your computer and these roms are named like
```
Adventures of Batman and Robin, The (U) [f1+2C].gen
Adventures of Batman and Robin, The (E) [!].gen
Adventures of Batman and Robin, The (U) [b2].gen
Adventures of Batman and Robin, The (U) [p1][!].gen
Altered Beast (UE) (REV02) [T+Por_Son_Car].gen
```

and you just don't know what all these chryptic names stands for

and you just want the best of these games filtered in an clean directory,

you probably need a tool like this ;)


## How to use it:
